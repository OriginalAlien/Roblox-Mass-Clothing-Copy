# Roblox-Mass-Clothing-Copy
Tool for Roblox That Steals &amp; Uploads Clothing, educational purposes only.  
**I recommend using VSC (Visual Studio Code) to run this**  
Edit: Completely forgot to upload "Storage" Folder, Sorry about that lol  
For `shirtTemplate.png` and `pantTemplate.png`, You Can Replace it With Your Own Custom Clothing Templates if You Want.  

# Features
- Copy Another Group's Clothing  
- Scrape and Copy Clothings on Catalog  
- Template Changer to Avoid Copyright  
- Project Clothing to Front Page Them  

# Instructions
1. Go into `config.json` and paste your cookie, you must have the cookie of a account with permissions to upload clothings to your group  
2. Set `templateChanger` to true or false if you want to enable/disable it, this helps to avoid copyright  
3. Set `customInfo` to true if you want to change the clothing's description and price, else it will upload clothings with it's original description and price  
4. Set `groupId` to the id of the group you're uploading the clothings to
